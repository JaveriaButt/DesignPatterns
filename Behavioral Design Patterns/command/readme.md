Scenario
You are developing a text editor application where users can interact with documents through a menu interface. The application supports various document operations like Open, Close, Cut, Copy, and Paste. Each menu item corresponds to a specific command that performs an operation on the document. Using the Command design pattern, you can encapsulate each document operation as a command object, allowing for easy management of actions, including undo/redo functionality.

Implementation Steps
Define the Command Interface:

Create an interface ICommand with a method Execute(). This interface will be implemented by all concrete command classes.
Create Concrete Command Classes:

Implement specific commands like OpenCommand, CloseCommand, CutCommand, CopyCommand, and PasteCommand. Each of these classes implements the ICommand interface and encapsulates the behavior of the corresponding document operation.
Create the Receiver Class:

Implement a Document class that contains the actual business logic for operations like Open(), Close(), Cut(), Copy(), and Paste(). This class acts as the receiver of the commands.
Create the Invoker Class:

Implement a Menu class that holds menu items. Each menu item is associated with a command. The Menu class will have methods to add menu items and execute the commands when a menu item is clicked.
Implement the Client Code:

Create instances of Document and concrete command classes. Associate the command objects with the corresponding menu items in the Menu class. Simulate user interactions by executing the commands through the menu.
Define the UML Diagram:

Use the UML diagram to visualize the relationships between the components, showing how the Application, Menu, MenuItem, Command, and Document classes interact.
