Imagine you're building a custom computer online. You have various options like CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and more. However, configuring each component manually can be overwhelming and prone to errors. You need a systematic approach to build your ideal computer without missing any essential parts or compatibility issues.

By implementing the Builder pattern, you can create a ComputerBuilder class responsible for constructing different configurations of computers. Each builder method handles a specific component, ensuring that the final product meets your requirements precisely. This approach provides flexibility, ease of use, and ensures consistency in computer construction.
